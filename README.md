# SMILESMerge

SMILESMerge is a Python program for that crosses two parent ligands to create a child compound. SMILESMerge is based on the crossover module of the program AutoGrow4.


# Acknowledgment and Citing

Much of this code is take directly and/or adapted from AutoGrow4. This program also relies on Gypsum-DL and Dimorphite-DL for ligand handling and multiprocessing. Please remember to cite the following papers:
